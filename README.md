# SQL-Project-Data-Scientist-Job-Salaries

This is a project to organize "Data Science Job Salaries" data using MySQL. Queries are used to obtain the desired results.
To make it more interesting, I tried to answer questions from my mentor in MySkill. This is the list of questions:

- Do the data have missing values?
- Checking what kind of data at the job_title column and how many their average salary based on their job?
- What job_title or position contains "data analyst"?
- What is the average salary of a data analyst job in USD?
- What is the average salary of a data analyst based on experience level?
- What is the average salary of a data analyst based on experience level and type of employment?
- Which countries with attractive salaries for data analyst positions, full-time, entry-level, and mid-level work experience?
- In which year did the salary increase from mid to senior have the highest increase? -- (for full-time data analyst-related jobs)
